In prometaphase, PLK1, likely recruited to cohesin complexes by binding to CDK1-phosphorylated CDCA5 (Sororin) (Zhang et al. 2011), phosphorylates cohesin subunits STAG2 (SA2) and RAD21 (Hauf et al. 2005). PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of cohesin subunits at centromeres is counteracted by the phosphatase activity of PP2A complex (containing the regulatory subunit B56 i.e. PPP2R5), which is recruited to the kinetochore by shugoshin proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2 (Kitajima et al. 2006). Therefore, while cohesin complexes dissociate from chromosomal arms in prometaphase (Hauf et al. 2001), they remain bound to centromeres until anaphase onset (Hauf et al. 2001, Hauf et al. 2005, Kitajima et al. 2006). When separase is activated after its inhibitor securin is degraded by APC/C at the onset of anaphase, RAD21 is cleaved by separase. Phosphorylation of RAD21 by PLK1 facilitates subsequent cleavage of RAD21 by separase (Hauf et al. 2005). There are several potential PLK1 phosphorylation sites in STAG2 and RAD21, but the exact positions of in vivo phosphorylation of STAG2 and RAD21 by PLK1 have not been explicitly established (Hauf et al. 2005)."

The cleavage of component C3 exposes a reactive thioester bond on C3b, leading to the covalent attachment of C3b to glycoproteins on the target cell surface (Law SK et al. 1979; Tack BF et al. 1980). The opsonization with C3b enables the recruitment of phagocytes (Newman SL et al. 1985; Gadjeva M et al. 1998).

In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009)."

All three serine residues and the adjoining sequences that mediate phosphorylation (Cohen 1988) are conserved in mouse perilipin, while only the first and third are conserved in human perilipin. By inference, PKA targets these three mouse and two human serines as well. Phosphorylated perilipin is redistributed on the droplet surfaces (Souza et al. 1998). While two isoforms of rat perilipin protein are found on lipid particles in adipocytes, only the larger isoform appears to regulate lipolysis (Tansey et al 2003). The single human and mouse isoforms of perilipin correspond to the large rat isoform. In mouse 3T3-L1 cells, perilipin phosphorylation requires the presence of caveolin-1 at the surface of the lipid particle (Cohen et al. 2004).

TSC2 forms a TSC1-TSC2 protein complex that is a GAP (GTPase activating protein) for the RHEB G-protein. RHEB, in turn, activates the TOR kinase. Thus, an active AKT1 activates the TOR kinase, both of which are positive signals for cell growth (an increase in cell mass) and division.<br>The TOR kinase regulates two major processes: translation of selected mRNAs in the cell and autophagy. In the presence of high nutrient levels TOR is active and phosphorylates the 4EBP protein releasing the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is essential for cap-dependent initiation of translation and promoting growth of the cell (PMID: 15314020). TOR also phosphorylates the S6 kinase, which is implicated in ribosome biogenesis as well as in the modification of the S6 ribosomal protein.

LAT and SLP-76 are both required for P-selectin expression and degranulation but may function independently, or rely on proteins not required by T-cells (Jordan et al. 2003)."

Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/)."

Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high.

The non-liganded NRs recruit specific corepressor complexes of the NCOR/SMRT type, to mediate transcriptional repression of the target genes to which they are bound. During signaling, ligand binding to a specific domain in the NR proteins induces a conformational change that results in the exchange of the associated corepressor complex, and its replacement by a specific coactivator complex of either the TRAP/DRIP/Mediator type, or the p160/SRC type. The Mediator coactivator complexes typically nucleate around the MED1 coactivator protein, which is directly bound to the NR transcription factor (reviewed in Freedman, 1999; Malik, 2005).<br><br> A general feature of the NR proteins is that they each contain a specific protein interaction domain (PID), or domains, that mediates the specific binding interactions with the MED1 proteins. In the ligand-bound state, NRs each take part in an NR-MED1 binding reaction to form an NR-MED1 complex. The bound MED1 then functions to nucleate the assembly of additional specific coactivator proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context, such as what specific target gene promoter or enhancer they are bound to, and in what cell type.<br><br> The formation of specific MED1-containing coactivator complexes on specific NR proteins has been well-characterized for a number of the human NR proteins. For example, binding of Vitamin D to the human Vitamin D3 Receptor was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of D Receptor Interacting Proteins - the DRIP coactivator complex (Rachez, 1998). Within the DRIP complex, the DRIP205 subunit was later renamed human ""MED1"", based on sequence similarities with yeast MED1 (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).<br><br> Similarly, binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to the human TH Receptor (THRA or THRB) was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of Thyroid Receptor Associated Proteins - the TRAP coactivator complex (Yuan, 1998). The TRAP220 subunit was later identified to be the Mediator 1 (MED1) homologue (summarized in Bourbon, et al., 2004; Table 1).<br><br> The 48 human NR proteins each contain the PID(s) known to mediate interaction with the human MED1 protein. Direct NR-MED1 protein-protein interactions have been shown for a number of the NR proteins. The MED1-interacting PIDs are conserved in all of the human NRs. Therefore, each of the human NRs is known or expected to interact with MED1 in the appropriate cell context, depending on the cell type, the cell state, and the target gene regulatory region involved."

The smallest characterized subassembly of SNAPc subunits that binds specifically to DNA consists of SNAP190 aa 84-505, SNAP43 aa 1-268, and SNAP50 (Ma and Hernandez, 2000). Consistent with the requirement for parts of SNAP190 and SNAP50 for DNA binding, UV cross-linking experiments suggest that both SNAP190 (Yoon et al., 1995) and SNAP50 (Henry et al., 1996) are in close contact with DNA.<p>The binding of SNAPc to the PSE is stabilized by a number of cooperative interactions with other members of the transcription initiation complex including Oct-1, TBP, and Brf2.<p>The binding of SNAPc to the core promoter is stabilized by a direct protein-protein contact with the Oct-1 POU domain.<p>SNAPc does not bind very efficiently to the PSE on its own.

The binding of the SMN complex to the snRNAs depends on the presence of specific, high-affinity (nanomolar) binding domains in the snRNAs. The SMN complex binds the Sm proteins through the Sm domains interaction with the Gemins, the TUDOR domain, and through unique arginine- and glycine-rich (RG) domains found in three of these, SmB, SmD1 and SmD3.

For example, the endogenous peptide ligands at the MOR induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and rapid receptor recycling. By contrast, morphine induces little to no endocytosis, tolerance and dependence. The agonist-dependent phosphorylation of opioid receptors changes the receptor conformation and increases the affinity of the receptors for cytosolic beta-arrestin proteins. This results in an uncoupling of G protein signalling and recruitment of the endocytotic machinery leading to receptor internalization and rapid resensitization.

Endorphins are processed from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (Takahashi H et al, 1981), which can also be processed to yield adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha- and gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). Beta-endorphin (Dragon N et al, 1977) is a 31 amino acid peptide found in neurons of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It is released into the blood (from the pituitary gland) and into the spinal cord and brain from hypothalamic neurons during vigourous exercise, excitement and orgasm. Beta-endorphin binds with the highest affinity to the mu-opioid receptor but it also possesses some affinity towards the delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Once bound, it acts as an analgesic in the body by dulling pain. It does this by breaking down bradykinins which are peptides which accumulate in response to injury. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) (Wang JB et al, 1994) possesses high affinity for enkephalins and beta-endorphin but low affinity for dynorphins.<br>The enkephalins are endogenous ligands, or specifically endorphins, as they are internally derived and bind to the body's opioid receptors. There are two forms of enkephalin, one containing leucine (""leu""), while the other contains methionine (""met""). The met-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded by the POMC gene whereas leu-enkephalin is coded by both POMC and dynorphin genes. Enkephalins are pentapeptides involved in regulating pain and nociception in the body. Their action is mediated through the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) (Knapp RJ et al, 1994).<br>Dynorphins constitute a class of opioid peptides that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin. When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2), multiple active peptides are released, amongst which are dynorphin A, dynorphin B, big-dyn and alpha/beta-neoendorphin (Day R et al, 1998). Dynorphins primarily exert their effects through the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein coupled receptor (Simonin F et al, 1995). Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2. Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins (James IF et al, 1982), the peptides do have some affinity for MOR and DOR."

The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane.

Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by a Complexin.

In general, exocytosis proceeds by formation of a ""SNARE pair"", a complex between a SNARE-type protein on the granule and a SNARE-type protein on the plasma membrane. (The interaction is between coiled coil domains on each SNARE-type protein.)<p>In the particular case of insulin granules in beta cells, the SNARE protein on the granule is Synaptobrevin2/VAMP2 and the SNARE protein on the plasma membrane is Syntaxin1A in a complex with SNAP-25. Unc18-1 binds Syntaxin1A and thereby prevents association with Synaptobrevin2 until dissociation of Unc18-1. Syntaxin 4 is also involved and binds filamentous actin but its exact role is unknown.<br>Insulin exocytosis occurs in two phases: 1) a rapid release of about 100 of the 1000 docked granules within the first 5 minutes of glucose stimulation and 2) a subsequent slow release over 30 minutes or more due to migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane. Data from knockout mice show that Syntaxin 1A is involved in rapid release but not slow release, whereas Syntaxin 4 is involved in both types of release.<p>Calcium dependence of membrane fusion is conferred by Synaptotagmin V, which binds calcium ions and associates with the Syntaxin1A-Synaptobrevin2 pair. The exact mechanism of Synaptotagmin's action is unknown. The migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane during slow release is also calcium dependent.<p>Microscopically, exocytosis is seen to occur as a ""kiss and run"" process in which the membrane of the secretory granule fuses transiently with the plasma membrane to form a small pore of about 4 nm between the interior of the granule and the exterior of the cell. Only a portion of the insulin in a granule is secreted after which the pore closes and the vesicle is recaptured back into the cell. Dynamin-1 and NSF may play a role in recapture but the mechanism is not fully known.<p>The major effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on insulin secretion is the inhibition of exocytosis of pre-existing insulin secretory granules. The inhibition occurs at a ""distal site"", that is, the effect is most pronounced on granules already near the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. The effect is caused by the Gi/o alpha:GTP complex but the exact mechanism by which Gi/o alpha:GTP inhibits exocytosis is unknown. On release, the higher pH in the extracellular region favours dissociation of Zn2+ from insulin. The insulin hexamer becomes unstable at this higher pH and it dissociates into the active insulin monomer."

The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing dyskerin, and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Recent studies of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA and two each of hTERT and DKC1 (dyskerin) proteins (Cohen et al. 2007). Several additional proteins may associate with this minimal complex and modulate its activity. RUVBL1 (pontin), RUVBL2 (reptin), and TCAB1 (telomere Cajal body protein 1) are found associated with human telomerase RNPs purified from HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly in vivo (Venteicher et al. 2008, 2009). NHP2 (NOLA2) is likewise associated with telomerase ribonucleoprotein complexes (Pogacic et al. 2000) and homozygosity for NHP2 mutations is associated with telomerase failure (dyskeratosis congenita) in humans (Vuillamy et al. 2008).

Some of the factors that regulate trafficking of these two core components of telomerase have been identified, such as nucleolin (Khurts et al. 2004), SMN (Bachand et al. 2002), and 14-3-3 (Seimiya et al. 2000). Cytological studies of HeLa cells suggest that the localization of the telomerase core components can change through the cell-cycle (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006).

A number of other proteins interact with the telomerase RNP, but it is not clear if they play a role in telomerase assembly.

BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999).

In this capacity Smo is not acting as a receptor, but as part of a signaling cascade. <br> <br> The Hedgehog(HH)/Smo signalling pathway was identified as a key component of Drosophila development and subsequently found to be conserved in all meatazoans. Most of the functions attributed to Smo are associated with development such as digit patterning in the chick limb bud and leftÃ¢Â€Â“right asymmetry of vertebrate embryos. In addition, Smo appears to be involved in homeostasis; deregulated Smo signaling is implicated in tumorogenesis (Ruiz-Gomez, 2007). <br> <br> The ligand of the 12 transmembrane-domain receptor Patched (Ptc) is Hedgehog(HH) but in the absence of HH, Ptc binds Smo (Stone et al. 1996) which consequently becomes internalised into endosomes, where it associates with Costal-2 (Cos2), and lysosomes, where it is degraded. This 'inactivates' Smo by preventing the formation of an active Smo signaling complex at the plasma membrane. Internalised Smo:Cos2 forms a complex with protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase I (CKI) glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Cucurbitus interruptus (Ci), a transcriptional regulator, enabling phosphorylation of Ci and subsequent processing to a transcriptional repressor form (CiR). When HH binds to Ptc, it does not bind Smo, allowing Smo to undergo a conformational change, exposing a new surface in its cytoplasmic tail. This causes PKA, CKI and GSK3 to dissociate from Smo:Cos2 complexes, so that Ci is no longer phosphorylated or processed to CiR. Accumulating Smo is phosphorylated instead and assumes a third conformational state. Phosphorylated Smo trafficks to the plasma membrane (Denef et al. 2000) and assembles into a signalling complex that promotes the phosphorylation of Fused (Fu) and Cos2. Phosphorylated Cos2 dissociates from membranes and recruits Fu to Sufu (Suppressor of Fused), which produces the activated form of Ci (CiA), probably through phosphorylation of Sufu (Hooper & Scott, 2005)."

BTK phosphorylates Phospholipase C gamma-2 (Rodriguez et al. 2001), which activates phospholipase activity (Carter et al. 1991, Roifman and Wang 1992, Kim et al. 2004, Sekiya et al. 2004).<br>Phosphorylated BLNK recruits PLC gamma, VAV, GRB2, and NCK (Fu and Chan 1997, Fu et al. 1998, Chiu et al. 2002).<br>SYK phosphorylates SHC which then binds GRB2 (Saxton et al. 1994, Harmer and DeFranco 1997).<br>CD19 in a stable complex with VAV1 is phosphorylated by Src kinases (inferred from mouse, Xu et al. 2002) and possibly by LYN (inferred from mouse, Fujimoto et al. 2000) in response to BCR activation.

Although structures of JAK kinase domains exist (e.g. Lucet et al. 2006) no complete structures of Janus kinases (JAKs) are available and the activation mechanism is poorly understood. Activation is believed to be a consequence of conformational changes, propagated from conformational changes in the common beta chain (Bc) following alpha-beta dimerization. This is believed to result in a trans-activation event whereby JAKs bound to activated, dimerized receptors phosphorylate and thereby activate each other (Quelle et al. 1994, Hou et al. 2002). This model is similar to IL2R activation of JAK1/3. In addition to the observed activation of JAK2 following stimulation with IL-3, IL-5 or GM-CSF, other supporting observations include: phosphorylation of JAK2 at Y1007 is critical for kinase activation (Feng et al. 1997, Lucet et al. 2006) and autophosphorylation at several other sites appears to regulate activity (e.g. Feener et al. 2004, Argetsinger et al. 2004, 2010). Only the critical Y1007 phosphorylation is represented for this reaction.<br><br>Constitutive activation of JAK2 resulting from the V617F mutation is present in over 95% of Polycythemia Vera patients (Dusa et al. 2010). F595 is indispensible for constitutive activation by V617F, but not for JAK2 activation, suggesting that this is not part of the cytokine-induced mechansim of JAK2 activation."

The identity of the ubiquitin ligase responsible is an open question, with several candidates capable of RIP2 ubiquitination. TRAF6 has been reported as the ubiquitin ligase responsible (Yang et al. 2007) but subsequent reports suggest it is not responsible (see Tao et al. 2009 and Bertrand et al. 2009). Other candidates include the HECT-domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, which is able to K63 ubiquitinate RIP2 (at an undetermined site that is not K209) and is required for optimal NOD2:RIP2-induced p38 and JNK activation, while inhibiting NOD2:RIP2-induced NFkappaB activation (Tao et al. 2009). The Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing proteins (Birc/cIAP) 2 and 3 have also been shown capable of RIP2 ubiquitination and required for NOD2 signaling (Bertrand et al. 2009). It has been suggested that ITCH and a K209 E3 ligase compete for ubiquitination of RIP2, so that a subset of RIP2 becomes ubiquitinated on K209 to stimulate NEMO ubiquitination and subsequent NFkappaB activation while a second subset of RIP2 is polyubiquitinated by ITCH to activate JNK and p38 signaling (Tao et al. 2009)."

One site is Y766 (numbered as Y750 by Sakamaki et al. 1992 and many other publications). Phosphorylation of Bc in response to GM-CSF/IL3 is observed at low temperatures (4 degrees C) that prevent the phosphorylation of other proteins, suggesting that the kinase responsible is likely to be physically associated with the receptor complex prior to stimulation (Miyajima et al. 1993). JAK2 is activated in response to IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF but signaling via JAK/STAT is not dependent on Bc tyrosine phosphorylation (Okuda et al. 1997). Based on these observations and the role of JAK1/3 in IL-2 signaling, JAK2 is believed to be the most likely candidate responsible for the phosphorylation of Bc (Guthridge et al. 1998). To represent the possible phosphorylation of Bc by kinases other than JAK2, this reaction includes receptor complexes with both active and inactive JAK2.

The DHR-2 domains of several DOCKs interact with the nucleotide-free forms of Rho GTPases, intermediates in the catalytic reaction leading to the exchange of GDP for GTP. DHR-2 domains have been shown necessary and sufficient to promote specific guanine nucleotide exchange on various Rho GTPases, both in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of the DHR-2 domain in DOCK1 (Dock180) has been shown to block Rac activation, cell migration and phagocytosis (Brugnera et al. 2002, Grimsley et al. 2004, Cote & Vuori 2002). The DHR-1 domain of DOCK1 was shown to mediate a specific interaction with PIP2 and PIP3 signaling lipids in vitro and in cells (Cote et al. 2005). Mutations of the DOCK1 DHR-1 domain blocked Rac-dependent cell elongation and cell migration suggesting that the role of DHR-1 is to position DOCK1 at sites of PIP3 production by PI3-kinase, coupling this to Rac signaling (Cote & Vuori 2007)."

Individually, IL2RA and IL2RB have low affinity for interleukin-2 (IL2); IL2RG has very low affinity. The IL2RA chain has a short cytoplasmic domain and consequently does not transmit an intracellular signal, but it binds IL-2 with high affinity and is required in vivo for detection of physiological IL-2 levels (Kd for IL-2RB/G = 10-9 M versus 10-11 M for IL-2RA/B/G, Takeshita et al. 1992). The crystal structure of the trimeric complex bound to IL2 suggests that the initiating event is the binding of IL2 to IL2R alpha (Wang et al. 2005). This captures IL2 at the cell surface and allows the recruitment of the beta and gamma subunits, which then participate in signal transduction. IL-2R alpha chains are expressed at much greater levels than the other receptor chains, usually 10-1000-fold higher compared with IL-2R beta or gamma (~1,000 sites/cell), which are usually expressed in equal numbers (Smith & Cantrell 1985). Recent single cell analysis methods have found that as the density of IL-2R alpha chains varies 1,000-fold from 100 to 100,000 sites/cell, the equilibrium dissociation constant of IL-2 binding varies to the same extent, from 100 pM to 100 fM, with the consequence that as the density of IL-2R alpha chains increases there is a marked improvement in IL-2 binding efficiency and thus signaling (Feinerman O et al. 2010).

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) binds to all types of amyloid fibrils and is a universal constituent of amyloid deposits. SAP binding protects amyloid fibrils from proteolytic degradation (Tennent et al. 1995, Westermark 2005). SAP may function as a chaperone for amyloid formation (Coker et al. 2000). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans are found associated with all types of amyloid deposits (Alexandrescu 2005). Of the different types of GAG heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are the most prominent in amyloid deposits (Hirschfield & Hawkins, 2003). GAGs have been implicated in the nucleation of fibrils, they can also stabilize mature fibrils against dissociation (Yamaguchi et al. 2003) and proteolytic degradation (Gupta-Bansal et al. 1995). Perlecan coimmunolocalizes with all types of amyloids (Snow & Wright 1989), accelerating fibril formation (Castillo et al. 1998), stabilizing them once formed (Castillo et al. 1997), and protecting them from proteolytic degradation (Gupta-Bansal et al. 1995).

The KRAB ZNF proteins are the largest subset of these (with 423 members) and are defined by having an additional conserved domain, the KRAB domain (Bellefroid,1991, Margolin, 1994, Urrutia, 2003, Huntley, 2006). The Kruppel Associated Box (KRAB) domain is a transcription repression domain (Margolin, 1994) which mediates the recruitment of a specific and dedicated co repressor protein for the KRAB-ZNF family - KAP1 - which is required for transcriptional repression and gene silencing (Friedman, 1996). </p> <p>The larger family of ZNF transcription factors are present in almost all metazoans and generally their DNA binding specificities and transcription regulation functions are conserved from Drosophila to humans. Although the biological functions of most ZNF TFs is not known, they often function biochemically as sequence specific DNA binding proteins and can be activators, or more oftenly observed, repressors of transcription, depending on cellular context. Transcriptional repression is mediated via specific protein protein interaction surfaces in the ZNF that function as repression domains, by recruiting specific co repressors, such as KAP1 in humans (Friedman, 1996), and dCTBP in Drosophila (Nibu, 1998). </p> <p>In contrast to the larger ZNF family, the KRAB-ZNFs only appear much later in vertebrate evolution: genes encoding the primordial KRAB ZNF subfamily first arose in tetrapods and the family has been greatly expanded in numbers and complexity in mammals. Interestingly,a large fraction of KRAB-ZNFs are found only in primates. In addition to their rapid and dynamic evolutionary history, comparative genomics and expression studies of primate KRAB-ZNFs suggest that these genes have played a significant role in shaping primate specific traits (Huntley, 2006, Nowick, 2009). </p> <p>The biochemical pathway utilized by KRAB-ZNFs is well defined and probably nearly identical for each member: All KRAB-ZNF proteins which have been studied in detail are repressors and utilize the KRAB domain to bind the KAP1 co-repressor. This interaction is direct, of high affinity, and is obligate for the KRAB-ZNF to function as a repressor when bound to DNA in vivo (Peng, 2000a,b).. The KAP1co-repressor appears to function as a scaffold protein to assemble and coordinate multiple enzymes (histone de-acetylases, histone methyltransferases and heterochromatin proteins) which target and modify chromatin structure thus leading to a compacted, silent state (Lechner, 2000; Schultz, 2001 Schultz, 2002 , Ayyanathan, 2003). The post-translational modification of KAP1 by SUMO controls its ability to assemble the enzymatic apparatus in chromatin (Ivanov, 2007; Zeng, 2008). It is formally possible that some KRAB ZNF proteins may have additional functional domains that recruit coactivators in specific contexts, given that such bifunctionality is common for many classes of DNA binding transcription factors,. However, there is no experimental evidence for this yet. </p> <p>There also is good evidence that the KRAB ZNF-KAP1 complex proteins can have long range gene silencing functions, by nucleating chromatin complexes that inactivate transcription of large numbers of genes over large distances by assembling silent heterochromatin (Ayyanathan, 2003). Although KAP1 was originally identified as a mediator of specific gene transcription repression, subsequent studies have shown that KAP1 also is involved in the recruitment of homologues of the HP1 protein family (Ryan, 1999, Ayyanathan, 2003; Lechner, 2000). These nonhistone heterochromatin associated proteins were first shown to have an epigenetic gene silencing function in Drosophila and more recently in mammalian cells . These studies suggest that KRAB ZNF proteins and KAP1 may also be involved in large scale chromatin regulation and gene silencing, not just in gene specific transcriptional repression. Whether this is a general property of most or all KRAB ZNF proteins will require additional studies. </p> <p>Finally, several KRAB containing ZNFs in mammals also contain a conserved SCAN domain which, like the KRAB domain also functions as a protein protein interaction domain. (Edelstein, 2005, Peng, 2000a,b). The SCAN domain does not participate in KAP1 binding but rather functions to mediate homodimerization, or selective heterodimerization with other SCAN containing proteins. However, the biochemical and biological functions of the SCAN domain in KRAB-ZNF mediated repression are not known. </p> <p>Remaining Questions: The single most important unanswered question for KRAB-ZNFDs is to determine their biological functions. While the mechanism utilized by the KRAB ZNF / KAP1 protein complex to mediate gene specific transcription repression is well understood , much less known about the specific biological pathways they control. Preliminary evidence from recent whole genome analysis of the target genes for the KRAB- ZNF263 protein suggest that it can have both positive and negative effects on transcriptional regulation of its target genes (Frietze, 2010). Presumably, each KRAB-ZNF, via its array of zinc fingers can bind to specific DNA recognition sequences in target promoters. This, combined with highly tissue specific expression of each gene, makes the potential transcriptome controlled by the 423 KRAB-ZNFs extremely large.</p>"	KAP (KRAB-Domain Associated Protein);KRAB-ZNF559ebc097aa7849c3aedbf0b	2010	binds	"Two RecA homologs, RAD51 and the meiosis-specific DMC1, coat single-stranded 3' ends of DNA produced by resection of double-strand breaks (Barlow et al. 1997, Masson et al. 1999, Sehorn et al. 2004, Sheridan et al. 2008, Okorokov et al. 2010).

PRDM9 recognizes a specific sequence motif, but also acts at human hotspots lacking the motif, suggesting it is capable of acting in cis to regulate hotspot activity.<br>These specific sequence motifs also appear to be species specific, as the degenerate 13-bp motif associated with 40% of human hotspots does not function in chimpanzees, probably as a result of the rapidly evolving zinc finger domain (Myers et al. 2010). Subtle changes in the zinc finger array in humans can have global effects on recombination throughout the human genome, enhancing or decreasing the activity of a hotspot, or even creating entirely new hotspots (Berg et al. 2010). In addition to its role in regulating recombination hotspot activity, PRDM9 also appears to have a role in maintaining stability within the human genome, as variation in the PRDM9 gene can lead to large-scale genomic rearrangements and minisatellite instability in humans."

The receptors bind melanin concentrating hormone, a cyclic peptide predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus that functions as a neurotransmitter controlling a range of functions. A major role of MCH is thought to be in the regulation of feeding: injection of MCH into rat brains stimulates feeding; expression of MCH is upregulated in the hypothalamus of obese and fasting mice; and mice lacking MCH are lean and eat less.

Loss of Cables1 function can lead to uncontrolled growth in vivo, observed in many human cancers, such as colon, lung and gynecological malignancies including ovarian and endometrial cancers (Sakamoto et al. 2008). Cables1 is up-regulated by progesterone and down-regulated by estrogen (Zukerberg et al. 2004). Cables1 is predominantly located in the nucleus of proliferating cells (Zukerberg et al. 2000, Wu et al. 2001) but some fully differentiated cells such as mature neurons have a significant proportion in the cytoplasm. Cables1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) 2, 3 and 5 (Wu et al. 2001, Matsuoka et al. 2000, Zukerberg et al. 2000). In neurons, Cables1 links Cdk5 and c-Abl, enhancing Cdk5 tyrosine-15 phosphorylation which results in increased Cdk5 activity, important in neurite outgrowth (Zukerberg et al. 2000). In proliferating cells, Cables1 links Cdk2 and Wee1, a dual specificity kinase. Phosphorylation of Cdk2 on tyrosine-15 by Wee-1 leads to decreased Cdk2 activity, Cables1 enhances this inhibitory phosphorylation (Wu et al. 2001). Cables1 has also been shown to interact with two regulators of apoptosis, p53 and p73. The physiological relevance of this interaction is not fully understood, but Cables1 augments p53-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells (Tsuji et al. 2002).

The SH2 domains of SHP1 and SHP2 associate with Y628 of Bc following IL-3 stimulation (Pei et al. 1994, Bone et al. 1997). SHPs act as regulators of signaling. SHP1 is thought to be a negative regulator of growth that terminates signals. Binding of SHP1 to EpoR leads to SHP1 activation and dephosphorylation of JAK2, terminating proliferative signals (Klingmuller et al. 1995). SHP1 has also been shown to interact directly and dephosphorylate JAK2 (Jiao et al. 1996). Although SHP-2 competes for the same binding site, it is thought to be a positive modulator. SHP2 associates with JAK1/2 and is phosphorylated at Y304 by these kinases, creating a GRB2 recognition motif (Yin et al. 1997). IL-3 induces the phosphorylation of SHP2 and its association with Grb2 (Welham et al. 1994). SHP2 could thereby act as an adaptor between Bc and Grb2 leading to activation of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. SHP2 can also associate with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Welham et al. 1994) so SHP2 may also regulate this pathway."

Phosphorylation of Cdk2 on tyrosine-15 by Wee-1 leads to decreased Cdk2 activity; Cables1 enhances this inhibitory phosphorylation (Wu et al. 2001). Cables1 has also been shown to interact with two regulators of apoptosis, p53 and p73. The physiological relevance of this interaction is not fully understood, but Cables1 augments p53-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells (Tsuji et al. 2002). Cables2 interacts with Cdk3, Cdk5 and c-Abl (Sato et al. 2002)."

Endocytosis of ubiquitinated Notch ligands is thought to mechanically stretch the ligand-bound Notch receptor, exposing the S2 cleavage site and resulting in Notch receptor cleavage by ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 metalloproteases (Itoh et al. 2003)."	MIB/NEURL;NOTC1559ebbb27aa7849c3aec3441	2011	translocation	"NOTCH ligands DLL1, DLL4, JAG1 and JAG2 undergo ubiquitination and endocytosis after binding NOTCH1 in trans. In Drosophila, ubiquitination of Delta and Serrate ligands is performed by either Mindbomb or Neuralized ubiquitin ligase. In mammals, there are two Mindbomb homologues, MIB1 and MIB2 and two Neuralized homologues, NEURL (also known as NEUR1) and NEURL1B (also known as NEUR2). Although both Mib1 and Mib2 ubiquitinate Delta (Koo et al. 2005), only Mib1 was shown to be essential for normal development in mice, with Mib1 deficient mice exhibiting typical Notch deficiency phenotypes (Koo et al. 2007). This could be due to different expression patterns of Mib1 and Mib2. While Mib1 is abundantly expressed in embryos and adult tissues, Mib2 expression is limited to adult tissues only (Koo et al. 2005). Mouse Neurl was directly shown to ubiquitinate Jag1 but not other Notch ligands in vitro. N-terminal myristoylation targets Neurl to the plasma membrane and this is a prerequisite for Jag1 internalization (Koutelou et al. 2008). Mouse Neurl1b was shown to directly bind and ubiquitinate recombinant Xenopus Delta and to cooperate with Mib1 in Delta endocytosis (Song et al. 2006). Ubiquitination of NOTCH ligands by MIB and NEURL ubiquitin ligases triggers ligand endocytosis. Drosophila Neuralized needs to interact with membrane phosphoinositides through its phosphoinositide-binding motif to trigger endocytosis of ubiquitinated Delta (Skwarek et al. 2007).

This could be due to different expression patterns of Mib1 and Mib2. While Mib1 is abundantly expressed in embryos and adult tissues, Mib2 expression is limited to adult tissues only (Koo et al. 2005). Mouse Neurl was directly shown to ubiquitinate Jag1 but not other Notch ligands in vitro. N-terminal myristoylation targets Neurl to the plasma membrane and this is a prerequisite for Jag1 internalization (Koutelou et al. 2008). Mouse Neurl1b was shown to directly bind and ubiquitinate recombinant Xenopus Delta and to cooperate with Mib1 in Delta endocytosis (Song et al. 2006). Ubiquitination of NOTCH ligands by MIB and NEURL ubiquitin ligases triggers ligand endocytosis. Drosophila Neuralized needs to interact with membrane phosphoinositides through its phosphoinositide-binding motif to trigger endocytosis of ubiquitinated Delta (Skwarek et al. 2007).

Hypophosphorylated SPRY2 binds to inactive B-RAF, preventing it from activating ERK signaling. MAPK activation results in phosphorylation of SPRY2 on six serine residues (S7, S42, S111, S120, S140 and S167), and inhibits B-RAF binding. Phosphorylation at S111 and S120 directly affects B-RAF binding while the remaining four sites appear to contribute indirectly. Oncogenic forms of B-RAF such as B-RAF V600E, which adopt active kinase conformations, do not associate with SPRY2, regardless of its phosphorylation status.

In vivo the majority of MMP14 is bound to TIMP2 and functions as a receptor for proMMP2 (Nishida et al. 2008). In contrast, activation of proMMP2 by MMP15 occurs in a TIMP independent manner, with TIMP2 inhibiting activation at all concentrations (Morrison et al. 2001). Native type I collagen binds to the hemopexin C domain of MMP14, and following clustering of the enzyme together enhances proMMP2 activation (Tam et al. 2002).

This domain is composed of eight fibronectin type III repeats, two von Willebrand factor A-like (vWFA) domains and one non-collagenous domain 4 (NC4 domain) related to collagen type IX. Collagen XIV is expressed in most mesenchymal tissues where it appears to interact with collagen type VI, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and matrix receptors (Brown et al. 1993, Imhof & Trueb 1998). It has been implicated as a regulator of fibrillogenesis. Collagen type XIV deficient mice have a grossly normal phenotype but their skin has altered mechanical properties. Tendons were seen to be enlarged at postnatal day 4 though mature tendons appeared normal. Tendons from postnatal day 7 KO mice had reduced strength but by 60 days were comparable with wild-type (Ansorge et al. 2009).

The box 1 region of PRLR is a membrane proximal proline-rich region in the intracellular domain, conserved in all members of the growth hormone rereptor family. This region is critical for JAK2 association; deletion of box 1 virtually abolishes PRLR signaling (Edery et al. 1994). Alanine substitutions of individual residues within box 1 of rat PRLR have shown that the most C-terminal proline (P269 in the Uniprot canonical sequence, 250 in the mature peptide) is critical for association with and subsequent activation of JAK2 (Pezet et al. 1997).

The sensitivity of microbes to beta-defensins correlates with the lipid composition of the membrane; more negatively-charged lipids correlate with larger beta-defensin 103-induced changes in membrane capacitance (Bohling et al. 2006). Beta-defensin-103 was observed to give rise to ionic currents in Xenopus membranes (Garcia et al. 2001) and cell wall perforation was observed in S. aureus when treated with HBD-3 (Harder et al. 2001). Two models explain how membrane disruption takes place. The 'pore model' postulates that beta-defenisns form transmembrane pores in a similar manner to alpha-defensins, while the 'carpet model' suggests that beta-defensins act as detergents, causing a less organised disruption. Beta-defensins have a structure that is topologically distinct from that of alpha-defensins, suggesting a different mode of dimerization and an electrostatic charge-based mechanism of membrane permeabilization rather than a mechanism based on formation of bilayer-spanning pores (Hoover et al. 2000)."

The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & MÃ¨ge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). CellÂ–cell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (NoÃ« et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa C-terminal fragment."

C-terminally truncated variants of FGFR2 that are preferrentially expressed in cancer show more potent transformation potential (Cha, 2008; Cha, 2009). These variants lack a number of carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues, including Y770 and Y773. Loss of Y770 contributes to transformation by enhancing FRS2 binding to the C-terminally truncated variant. This suggests that in the context of the full-length protein the presence of Y770 restricts access of FRS2 to the receptor. Loss or mutation of Y773 impairs internalization and degradation of the receptor and promotes sustained signaling (Cha, 2009). Gastric cancer cell lines with FGFR2 amplifications appear to undergo ligand-independent signaling and are sensitive to inhibition with ATP-competitive inhibitors (Takeda, 2007). <br><br><br>FGFR2 amplifications identified in 4% of triple negative breast cancers have also been shown to be constitutively active and to have elevated levels of phosphorylated FRS2 in the absence of ligand.

Similar to GORASP1, GORASP2 is involved in the maintenance of Golgi structure and positively regulates stacking of Golgi cisternae (Xiang and Wang 2010). In addition, GORASP2, probably through its association with RAB2A GTPase, regulates trafficking through the Golgi (Short et al. 2001). In G2 and mitotic prophase, GORASP2 is phosphorylated by MEK1/2 activated MAP kinases. Monophosphorylated MAPK3 (ERK1) isoform, MAPK3 3 i.e. ERK1b (known as ERK1c in rat), likely activated by a MEK1 isoform MEK1b (Shaul et al. 2009), as well as MAPK1 (ERK2) are implicated in GORASP2 phosphorylation during mitosis (Jesch et al. 2001, Colanzi et al. 2003, Shaul and Seger 2006, Feinstein and Linstedt 2007, Duran et al. 2008, Feinstein and Linstedt 2008).

The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & MÃ¨ge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). CellÂ–cell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (NoÃ« et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa c-terminal fragment."

The ADA2A-containing (ATAC) complex shares with SAGA a core composed of KAT2A-TADA3 (ADA3)-CCDC101 (STAF36, SGF29) and either TADA2A (ADA2a) in ATAC, or TADA2B (ADA2b) in SAGA. ATAC complexes contain a second putative HAT, called CSRP2BP (ATAC2), and five other subunits; YEATS2, ZZZ3, MBIP, WDR5, and DR1 (NC2-Beta) (Guelman et al. 2009). CSRP2BP has weak HAT activity in vitro but it's main function is to maintain the structural integrity of ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009). At present, the biological function of the ATAC complex is not well understood. In vitro GCN5 acetylates mainly histone H3K14 (lysine-15 in the UniProt peptide which retains the initiating methionine), but when incorporated into the SAGA complex GCN5 becomes more efficient as an H3K14 acetylase and can also acetylate H3K9 and H3K18 (Brand et al. 1999, Grant et al. 1999), H3K23, and H3K27 (Kuo et al. 1996, Kuo & Andrews 2013). Drosophila ATAC mainly acetylates histone H4 (Ciurciu et al. 2006, Suganuma et al. 2008), suggested to be due to the presence of CSRP2BP in the complex (Suganuma et al. 2008) but different human ATAC preparations have exhibited a range of specificities with no clear difference between SAGA and ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2008, Nagy et al. 2010).

The ADA2A-containing (ATAC) complex shares with SAGA a core composed of KAT2A-TADA3 (ADA3)-CCDC101 (STAF36, SGF29) and either TADA2A (ADA2a) in ATAC, or TADA2B (ADA2b) in SAGA. ATAC complexes contain a second putative HAT, called CSRP2BP (ATAC2), and five other subunits; YEATS2, ZZZ3, MBIP, WDR5, and DR1 (NC2-Beta) (Guelman et al. 2009). CSRP2BP has weak HAT activity in vitro but it's main function is to maintain the structural integrity of ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009). At present, the biological function of the ATAC complex is not well understood. In vitro GCN5 acetylates mainly histone H3K14 (lysine-15 in the UniProt peptide which retains the initiating methionine), but when incorporated into the SAGA complex GCN5 becomes more efficient as an H3K14 acetylase and can also acetylate H3K9 and H3K18 (Brand et al. 1999, Grant et al. 1999), H3K23, and H3K27 (Kuo et al. 1996, Kuo & Andrews 2013). Drosophila ATAC mainly acetylates histone H4 (Ciurciu et al. 2006, Suganuma et al. 2008), suggested to be due to the presence of CSRP2BP in the complex (Suganuma et al. 2008) but different human ATAC preparations have exhibited a range of specificities with no clear difference between SAGA and ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2008, Nagy et al. 2010). SAGA and ATAC complexes from mouse and human contain either GCN5 or PCAF in a mutually exclusive manner (Nagy et al. 2010, Krebs et al. 2010, Spedale et al. 2012).<br><br>The SAGA complex consists of KAT2A (hGCN5), TADA1 (STAF42), TADA2B (ADA2b), TADA3 (STAF54, ADA3), SUPT3H (SPT3), SUPT7L (STAF65G), TAF5L (PAF65B), TAF6L (PAF65A), TAF9 (TAFII31), TAF12 (TAFII20), TAF10 (TAFII31), TRRAP, SAP130 (Martinez et al. 2001), CCDC101, ATXN7, a factor termed STAF55 that cannot be identified, two further factors described as probable members that cannot be identified STAF46 and STAF60 (Nagy & Tora 2007) plus ATXN7L3, USP22, ENY2 (Zhao et al. 2008) and SUPT20H (Nagy et al. 2009).<br><br>N.B. Coordinates of post-translational modifications described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing. Histone literature typically refers to coordinates of the protein after the initiating methionine has been removed. Therefore the coordinates of post-translated residues in the Reactome database and described here are frequently +1 when compared with the literature."

Substitution of Ser303 with alanine derepresses the transactivation domain such that the S303A mutant showed increased transcriptional activity in human and mouse cells (Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Morimoto RI 1997). Phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser303 was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity in human acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (Chu B et al. 1996, 1998). However, the other group showed that GSK3 inhibits HSF1 activity in HeLa cells through a mechanism that is independent of Ser303 phosphorylation, thus suggesting that Ser303 may be phosphorylated by multiple MAPKs (Batista?Nascimento L et al. 2011). The phosphorylation at Ser303 in turn promoted HSF1 association with YWHAE (14-3-3 epsilon), which may be involved in the attenuation of HSF1 activity during recovery leading to accelerated cytoplasmic localization of HSF1 (Wang X et al. 2003, 2004).In addition, stress stimulated human K562 erythroleukemia cells showed enhanced level of sumoylation in the HSF1 regulatory domain at Lys298, which was positively regulated by Ser303 phosphorylation (Hietakangas V et al. 2003)."

The released HSF1 monomer is rapidly converted to a homotrimer (Baler R et al. 1993; Herbomel G et al 2013). Upon trimerization HSF1 undergoes significant conformational changes resulting in an assembly of a stable triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure with the amino-terminal hydrophobic domains from individual monomeric units (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). Biochemical and structural analysis strongly suggest that the monomer-to-trimer transition is tightly regulated at several interdependent levels. Thus, HSPs and cofactors bind HSF1 monomers preventing trimerization (Zou J et al.1998; Guo Y et al. 2001). In addition, leucine zippers (LZ) in the trimerization domain (LZ1-LZ3) are thought to retain HSF1 in its inactive monomeric form by intramolecular coiled-coil interactions with LZ4 in the carboxyl-terminus of HSF1, while LZ interactions between trimerization domains of individual monomeric units facilitate homotrimerization (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). HSF1 flexible linker region between DNA binding domain and first LZ of the trimerization domain was also found to modulate the monomer-trimer equilibrium (Liu PCC and Thiele DJ 1999). Furthermore, intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 36 and 103 were reported to stabilize HSF1 trimer, while intramolecular disulfide crosslink inhibited HSF1 oligomerization (Lu M et al. 2008, 2009). Moreover, redox regulatory mechanisms were shown to regulate thiol-disulfide exchange and the conformation and activity of mammalian HSF1 in response to stress (Manalo DJ et al. 2002; Ahn SG and Thiele DJ 2003).<p>A ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation elongation factor EEF1A1 (eEF1A) and a long non-coding RNA, HSR1 (heat shock RNA-1) was shown to mediate trimerization of HSF1 (Shamovsky I et al. 2006)."	eEF1A;HSF1559ebbaa7aa7849c3aec11c5	2013	adds_modification	"All characterized lysine demethylases other than KDM1A belong to the jumonjiC domain (JmjC) containing family.The JmjC KDMs are members of the Cupin superfamily of mononuclear Fe (II) dependent oxygenases, which are characterized by the presence of a double-stranded beta-helix core fold.

The ADA2A-containing (ATAC) complex shares with SAGA a core composed of KAT2A-TADA3 (ADA3)-CCDC101 (STAF36, SGF29) and either TADA2A (ADA2a) in ATAC, or TADA2B (ADA2b) in SAGA.

CSRP2BP has weak HAT activity in vitro but it's main function is to maintain the structural integrity of ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009). At present, the biological function of the ATAC complex is not well understood. In vitro GCN5 acetylates mainly histone H3K14 (lysine-15 in the UniProt peptide which retains the initiating methionine), but when incorporated into the SAGA complex GCN5 becomes more efficient as an H3K14 acetylase and can also acetylate H3K9 and H3K18 (Brand et al. 1999, Grant et al. 1999), H3K23, and H3K27 (Kuo et al. 1996, Kuo & Andrews 2013). Drosophila ATAC mainly acetylates histone H4 (Ciurciu et al. 2006, Suganuma et al. 2008), suggested to be due to the presence of CSRP2BP in the complex (Suganuma et al. 2008) but different human ATAC preparations have exhibited a range of specificities with no clear difference between SAGA and ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2008, Nagy et al. 2010).

The Sin3 complex consists of this core complex plus SAP18 and SAP30, which appear to aid in stabilizing the protein associations and Sin3A, which serves as a scaffold for assembly of the complex and its interaction with various DNA binding proteins (Ayer 1999). Mammals express two Sin3 proteins, Sin3A and Sin3B.

A 'core complex' of HDAC1/2 and the histone binding proteins RBBP7 (RbAp46) and RBBP4 (RbAp48), has been described in vivo and in vitro (Zhang et al. 1999). The Sin3 complex consists of this core complex plus SAP18 and SAP30, which appear to aid in stabilizing the protein associations and Sin3A, which serves as a scaffold for assembly of the complex and its interaction with various DNA binding proteins (Ayer 1999). Mammals express two Sin3 proteins, Sin3A and Sin3B. The recognized Sin3A core complex contains the HDAC1-2 catalytic core, SAP18 (Zhang et al. 1997), SAP30 (Zhang et al. 1998), RBBP7/4 (Ahringer 2000), SUDS3 (SAP45, SDS3) (Alland et al. 2002), ARID4B (SAP180) and SAP130 (Fleischer et al. 2003). Additional members are BRMS1 (breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1), ARID4A (Rb-binding protein 1) (Meehan et al. 2004) and SAP30L (Viiri et al. 2006). The Sin3A complex preferentially binds to hypoacetylated histones through the RBBP7/4 subunits (Vermeulen et al. 2004, Yoon et al. 2005). It can also be recruited to chromatin through the H3K4-di/trimethyl mark by ING1/2 (Shi et al. 2006, Pena et al. 2008).<br><br>The Sin3B complex shares some subunits in common with the Sin3A complex but may also contain distinct subunits (Le Guezennec et al. 2006a).<br><br>The NuRD complex contains a core histone deacetylase complex that consists of the HDAC1-2 catalytic core plus RBBP7 (RbAp46) and RBBP4 (RbAp48) (Ahringer 2000). The largest and key component is the Mi-2 remodelling subunit (dermatomyositis-specific autoantigen), which contains the ATPase/chromatin remodelling activity and physically associates with the other components. Mammals have two Mi-2 proteins: CHD3 (Mi-2alpha), and CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) (Seelig et al. 1996). CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) is the form predominantly associated with the NuRD complex (Zhang et al. 1998, Feng & Zhang 2001), although CHD3 is a member of the NuRD complex in a variety of human cell lines (Le Guezennec et al. 2006b). It is not clear whether functional differences exist between CHD3 and CHD4-containing complexes (McDonel et al. 2009). Further components are MBD3 (methyl CpG-binding domain 3), and a metastasis-associated (MTA) protein subunit. MTA subunits (e.g. Mta1, Mta2 or Mta3) appear to be mutually exclusive, possibly contributing to functional diversity of NuRD complexes (Bowen et al. 2004, Fujita et al. 2004). GATAD2A and GATAD2B proteins (formerly known as p66alpha and p66beta) are often reported as members of NuRD.

Mammals express two Sin3 proteins, Sin3A and Sin3B. The recognized Sin3A core complex contains the HDAC1-2 catalytic core, SAP18 (Zhang et al. 1997), SAP30 (Zhang et al. 1998), RBBP7/4 (Ahringer 2000), SUDS3 (SAP45, SDS3) (Alland et al. 2002), ARID4B (SAP180) and SAP130 (Fleischer et al. 2003). Additional members are BRMS1 (breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1), ARID4A (Rb-binding protein 1) (Meehan et al. 2004) and SAP30L (Viiri et al. 2006). The Sin3A complex preferentially binds to hypoacetylated histones through the RBBP7/4 subunits (Vermeulen et al. 2004, Yoon et al. 2005). It can also be recruited to chromatin through the H3K4-di/trimethyl mark by ING1/2 (Shi et al. 2006, Pena et al. 2008).<br><br>The Sin3B complex shares some subunits in common with the Sin3A complex but may also contain distinct subunits (Le Guezennec et al. 2006a).<br><br>The NuRD complex contains a core histone deacetylase complex that consists of the HDAC1-2 catalytic core plus RBBP7 (RbAp46) and RBBP4 (RbAp48) (Ahringer 2000). The largest and key component is the Mi-2 remodelling subunit (dermatomyositis-specific autoantigen), which contains the ATPase/chromatin remodelling activity and physically associates with the other components. Mammals have two Mi-2 proteins: CHD3 (Mi-2alpha), and CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) (Seelig et al. 1996). CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) is the form predominantly associated with the NuRD complex (Zhang et al. 1998, Feng & Zhang 2001), although CHD3 is a member of the NuRD complex in a variety of human cell lines (Le Guezennec et al. 2006b). It is not clear whether functional differences exist between CHD3 and CHD4-containing complexes (McDonel et al. 2009). Further components are MBD3 (methyl CpG-binding domain 3), and a metastasis-associated (MTA) protein subunit. MTA subunits (e.g. Mta1, Mta2 or Mta3) appear to be mutually exclusive, possibly contributing to functional diversity of NuRD complexes (Bowen et al. 2004, Fujita et al. 2004). GATAD2A and GATAD2B proteins (formerly known as p66alpha and p66beta) are often reported as members of NuRD. MBD3 can be replaced by related protein MBD2, forming the MeCP1 complex (Feng & Zhang 2001, Le Guezennec et al. 2006b). The MeCP1 complex represents only a small proportion of the total NuRD complex in mammalian cells (Refs. in McDonel et al. 2009); MBD2 has been shown to be dispensable for normal mammalian development (Hendrich et al. 2001).<br><br>NuRD is recruited via MDB3 for DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing. It associates with MeCP1 (methyl CpG-binding protein 1) and MeCP2 to provide an intimate connection with DNA methylation (Denslow & Wade 2007, Klose & Bird 2006). <br><br>The CoREST complex minimally contains the HDAC1-2 catalytic core, REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor), RCOR1 (CoREST, KIAA0071) and KDM1A (BHC110, LSD1) (Andres et al. 1999, Humphrey et al. 2001). The BRAFÂ–HDAC (BHC) complex consists of HDAC1-2, RCOR1, KDM1A, HMG20B (BRAF35) and PHF21A (BHC80) (Hakimi et al. 2002, Yang & Seto 2008).<br><br>This reaction represents a theoretical complete deacetylation of histone."

The largest and key component is the Mi-2 remodelling subunit (dermatomyositis-specific autoantigen), which contains the ATPase/chromatin remodelling activity and physically associates with the other components. Mammals have two Mi-2 proteins: CHD3 (Mi-2alpha), and CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) (Seelig et al. 1996). CHD4 (Mi-2 beta) is the form predominantly associated with the NuRD complex (Zhang et al. 1998, Feng & Zhang 2001), although CHD3 is a member of the NuRD complex in a variety of human cell lines (Le Guezennec et al. 2006b). It is not clear whether functional differences exist between CHD3 and CHD4-containing complexes (McDonel et al. 2009). Further components are MBD3 (methyl CpG-binding domain 3), and a metastasis-associated (MTA) protein subunit. MTA subunits (e.g. Mta1, Mta2 or Mta3) appear to be mutually exclusive, possibly contributing to functional diversity of NuRD complexes (Bowen et al. 2004, Fujita et al. 2004). GATAD2A and GATAD2B proteins (formerly known as p66alpha and p66beta) are often reported as members of NuRD. MBD3 can be replaced by related protein MBD2, forming the MeCP1 complex (Feng & Zhang 2001, Le Guezennec et al. 2006b). The MeCP1 complex represents only a small proportion of the total NuRD complex in mammalian cells (Refs. in McDonel et al. 2009); MBD2 has been shown to be dispensable for normal mammalian development (Hendrich et al. 2001).<br><br>NuRD is recruited via MDB3 for DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing.

The Sin3 complex consists of this core complex plus SAP18 and SAP30, which appear to aid in stabilizing the protein associations and Sin3A, which serves as a scaffold for assembly of the complex and its interaction with various DNA binding proteins (Ayer 1999). Mammals express two Sin3 proteins, Sin3A and Sin3B. The recognized Sin3A core complex contains the HDAC1-2 catalytic core, SAP18 (Zhang et al. 1997), SAP30 (Zhang et al. 1998), RBBP7/4 (Ahringer 2000), SUDS3 (SAP45, SDS3) (Alland et al. 2002), ARID4B (SAP180) and SAP130 (Fleischer et al. 2003).

Although an initial study suggested that conserved Cys77 in mouse Wnt3a was palmitoylated (Willert et al, 2003), further work showed that mutation of this residue had minimal effect on WNT secretion (Komekado et al, 2007). In contrast, addition of palmitoleic acid to mWnt3a Ser209 is essential for WNT secretion, and mutant S209A is largely retained in the ER (Takada et al, 2006; Galli and Burrus, 2011). This serine residue is conserved at this position in all known WNTs with the exception of Drosophila WntD (Ching et al, 2008; Herr and Basler, 2012). A recent crystal structure of Xenopus WNT8 in complex with a Frizzled cysteine-rich-domain shows a single lipid modification on the conserved serine residue, while the conserved cysteine participates in a disulphide bond (Janda et al, 2012). In addition to being required for secretion, the lipid at S209 also makes direct contact with a groove in the Frizzled receptor and is thus essential for binding (Janda et al, 2012). <br><br>Porcupine is a conserved multi-pass transmembrane ER protein that has an O-acyl-transferase domain (van den Heuvel et al, 1993; Kadowaki et al, 1996; Hofmann, 2000). First identified in Drosophila, Porcupine is a WNT-specific modulator that is required for Wingless processing and secretion (Kadowaki et al, 1996). In porcn-deficient cells, Wg and WNT3A have decreased palmitoylation at S209 and accumulate in the ER (Takada et al, 2006), and mutations in PORCN eliminate all WNT signalling and cause embryonic lethality in mice (Barrott et al, 2011; Biechele et al, 2011).

Activated LIMK phosphorylates CFL1 on the conserved serine 3 residue located near the actin-binding site. After phosphorylation, CFL1 is inactive, loses its affinity for actin and dissociates from G-actin monomers.

GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high.

Repulsive signaling outcomes that promote cell-cell disengagement involve removal of the cell surface EPH:EFN complexes rather than dissociation of the bound proteins (Litterst et al. 2007). Removal of EPH:EFN complexes is mediated by a mechanism involving a metalloprotease enzyme bound to EFN or EPH receptors, which is activated after a time delay to cleave EFN or EPH. Through this mechanism, the mechanical adhesion between EFN and EPH on different cell surfaces is broken, resulting in the two cells moving apart. ADAMs (a disintegrin and a metalloprotease) are proteases responsible for the regulated ectodomain shedding of protein receptors like TGF-alpha, TNF-alpha, and the notch ligand Delta, a process that is critical to their signaling function. Similarly, EFNAs have been identified as substrates for membrane-bound ADAM10/Kuzbanian/KUZ. Flanagan and colleagues showed that ADAM10 is constitutively associated with EFNA2, and mediates the cleavage of EFNA2 ectodomain upon EPHA3:EFNA2 complex formation . This EFN cleavage mechanism was proposed to occur in cis (where both the proteinase and its substrate are within the same cell membrane) (Hattori et al. 2000). Janes et al. show the alternate model to that of the Flangan group. They showed that ADAM10 constitutively associates with the EPHA3 receptor, rather than EFNA and cleaves EFNA5 from its membrane tether only in trans (where the proteinase and its substrate are on opposing cell membrane) (Janes et al. 2005).

The substrate binding to SIRT1 can be interrupted by DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1), which was found to associate with the catalytic core domain of SIRT1 (Zhao W et al. 2008; Kim JE et al. 2008). DBC1 inhibited NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of SIRT1 in response to DNA damage or oxidative stress in human and mouse cells (Zhao W et al. 2008; Kim JE et al. 2008; Yuan J et al. 2012). <p>The stress-induced DBC1-SIRT1 interaction required the ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of DBC1 at Thr454 (Yuan J et al. 2012; Zannini L et al. 2012).

In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and W have the extra cysteine required for form hexamers. All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first of the family to be discovered and is the best characterised (Midwood et al. 2011). Its subunits vary greatly in size (between 190 and 330 kDa of the tenascin-C monomer) due to glycosylation and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic development TNC is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults it is detectable only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such as wound repair and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and is expressed only in the developing and adult central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null mice (single and double knock-outs) have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but exhibit behavioural and wound healing abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz & Montag 2003). TNX (termed tenascin-Y in chicken) is the largest member of the family and is widely expressed during development, but in adults is limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal tissue. It can form trimers, though it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues involved in hexamer formation. It is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable connective tissue disorder known as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with fibrillar collagen defects (Burch et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann 2004). TNW, first identified in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well characterized member of the tenascin family. It forms trimers and is expressed in developing skeletal tissue, neural crest cells and kidney, a pattern that partially overlaps with TN-C. <br><br>TNC binds syndecan-3 (Salmivirta et al. 1991, Koyama et al. 1996) Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 glycosaminoglycan attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan-3 on the cell surface is frequently oligomeric (Asundi & Carey 1995). Syndecans bind extracellular ligands via their attached heparan sulphate chains, playing roles in cell to matrix and cell to cell adhesion."

This association between EPHs and EFNs on opposing cells is called trans-interaction and this close contact is required for signaling. This high affinity interaction usually result in contact-mediated repulsion. With some exceptions, B-type EPH receptors (EPHB1-B6) interact with the B-subclass ephrins (EFNB1-B3).

The reorganization of heterochromatin into SAHFs is accompanied by reduction in the amount of total and chromatin-bound lamin B1 (LMNB1), and high levels of LMNB1 interfere with SAHF formation (Sadaie et al. 2013). High-mobility group A proteins, HMGA1 and HMGA2, are enriched on chromatin of senescent cells, predominantly localizing to SAHFs, and high HMGA1 and HMGA2 levels, in cooperation with p16-INK4A, promote SAHF formation and repression of E2F target genes in senescent cells. Overexpression of CDK4 and MDM2, which are frequently co-amplified with HMGA2 in cancer cells as a part of 12q13-15 chromosomal band amplification, bypasses HMGA2 and HMGA1 induced cell cycle arrest and SAHF formation (Narita et al. 2006). The accumulation of HMGA proteins on senescent cell chromatin and SAHF formation is accompanied by the loss of the linker histone H1, probably due to a posttranslational mechanism (Funayama et al. 2006).

Binding of APC is correlated with dissociation of the activator complex and precedes recruitment of TLE1 and HDAC1, suggesting that APC may promote the exchange between activator and repressor complexes at the enhancer (Sierra et al, 2006). CSNK1gamma phosphorylation of APC strongly increases its affinity for beta-catenin, and a phosphorylated APC fragment disrupts the formation of a DNA:LEF1:beta-catenin complex by EMSA, consistent with previous reports (Xing et al, 2003; Xing et al, 2004; Sierra et al, 2006). Because beta-catenin is unable to simultaneously bind APC and TCF/LEF, however, the mechanism of APC recruitment to the enhancer complex is unclear (Sierra et al, 2006). Full-length APC associates with CTBP in vitro and in vivo (Hamada and Bienz, 2004; Sierra et al, 2006) while Class I and Class II mutant APC proteins, which are commonly found in colorectal cancers, do not (Sierra et al, 2006; reviewed in Neufeld, 2009).

In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and W have the extra cysteine required for form hexamers. All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first family member to be discovered and is the best characterised. Its subunits vary greatly in size (between 190 and 330 kDa of the tenascin-C monomer) due to glycosylation and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic development TNC is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults it is detectable only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such as wound repair and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis (Midwood & Orend 2009). TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and is expressed only in the developing and adult central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null mice (single and double knock-outs) have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but exhibit behavioural and wound healing abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz & Montag 2003). TNX is the largest member of the family and is widely expressed during development, but in adults is limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal tissue. It can form trimers, though it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues involved in hexamer formation. It is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable connective tissue disorder known as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with fibrillar collagen defects (Burch et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann 2004). TNW, first identified in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well characterized member of the tenascin family.

It was initially characterized in yeast as a pentameric complex required for the recycling of the transmembrane receptor VPS10 to the trans-Golgi, and was subsequently shown to be conserved in flies, worms and humans. In humans, retromer consists of a cargo-recognition subcomplex made up of VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29 and a membrane-targeting subcomplex containing a heterodimer of SNX proteins (SNX1 or 2 paired with SNX5 or 6). The SNX proteins contain a BAR domain that is believed to promote membrane curvature, and SNX-BAR proteins are thought to aid in the formation of endosomal membrane tubules into which cargo is loaded (reviewed in Pfeffer, 2001; Seaman, 2012). <br><br>Retromer is required for the recycling of WLS to the Golgi to allow further rounds of WNT-ligand delivery to the plasma membrane (Coudreuse et al 2006; Belenkaya et al 2008; Port et al, 2008). In the absence of essential retromer component VPS35 or VPS26, WLS is diverted to the MVB and degraded, and WNT ligand accumulates inside the cell; overexpression of WLS is sufficient to rescue the vps35 defect in WNT signaling (Belenkaya et al, 2006; Franch-Marro et al, 2008). WLS and retromer colocalize on endosomal structures and WLS and VPS35 co-precipitate in pull down studies (Belenkaya et al, 2006; Port et al, 2008; Franch-Marro et al, 2008). <br><br>Several recent studies have suggested that WLS recycling depends on a WNT-specific retromer in which the SNX-BAR proteins of the classic complex are replaced by SNX3 (Zhang et al, 2011; Harterink et al, 2011; reviewed in Johannes and Wunder, 2011). Unlike SNX1/2/5/6, SNX3 does not contain a BAR domain, and WLS is suggested to accumulate in endocytic vesicles rather than in the tubular structures of the 'classic' retromer (Harterink et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2011). SNX3 is recruited from the cytosol to the early endosome through the interaction of its PX domain with PIP3 in the membrane. Mutation of critical residues in the PX domain abolish the interaction with PIP3 and ablate endsomal recruitment of SNX3 (Xu et al, 2001; Zhang at al, 2011; Harterink et al, 2011).

Integrity of the intracellular domain of DLL1 was shown to be essential for the successful release of NOTCH2 intracellular domain, NICD2, in response to DLL1 binding (Shimizu et al. 2002). In Drosophila, ubiquitination of Delta and Serrate ligands is performed by either Mindbomb or Neuralized ubiquitin ligase. In mammals, there are two Mindbomb homologues, MIB1 and MIB2 and two Neuralized homologues, NEURL (also known as NEUR1) and NEURL1B (also known as NEUR2). Although both Mib1 and Mib2 ubiquitinate Delta (Koo et al. 2005), only Mib1 was shown to be essential for normal development in mice, with Mib1 deficient mice exhibiting typical Notch deficiency phenotypes (Koo et al. 2007). This could be due to different expression patterns of Mib1 and Mib2. While Mib1 is abundantly expressed in embryos and adult tissues, Mib2 expression is limited to adult tissues only (Koo et al. 2005). Mouse Neurl was directly shown to ubiquitinate Jag1 but not other Notch ligands in vitro. N-terminal myristoylation targets Neurl to the plasma membrane and this is a prerequisite for Jag1 internalization (Koutelou et al. 2008). Mouse Neurl1b was shown to directly bind and ubiquitinate recombinant Xenopus Delta and to cooperate with Mib1 in Delta endocytosis (Song et al. 2006). Ubiquitination of NOTCH ligands by MIB and NEURL ubiquitin ligases triggers ligand endocytosis. Drosophila Neuralized needs to interact with membrane phosphoinositides through its phosphoinositide-binding motif to trigger endocytosis of ubiquitinated Delta (Skwarek et al. 2007). The pulling force model states that the endocytosis of ubiquitinated Notch ligands mechanically pulls the ligand-bound Notch receptor, exposing the S2 cleavage site and resulting in Notch receptor cleavage by ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 metalloproteases (Itoh et al. 2003). Using a cell-bead optical tweezers system to measure rupture force specific for cells expressing Dll1 bound to laser trapped Notch1 beads, it was shown that the mechanical force required for the activation of Notch signaling depends on ligand ubiquitination and subsequent clathrin-mediated endocytosis that involves dynamin, epsins and actin (Meloty-Kapella et al. 2012).

The C-terminal end of beta-catenin interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers, while the N-terminal region recruits more WNT-specific activators including BCL9 and Pygopus (reviewed in Jessen et al, 2008). BCL9 proteins (2 in vertebrates, BCL9 and BCL9L) interact with both beta-catenin and the putative activator Pygo (also 2 in vertebrates, Pygo1 and Pygo2) and in this way function as a bridging molecule to promote WNT-dependent transcription (reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012).<br>BCL9 was identified as the gene overexpressed in a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Willis et al, 1998) and was subsequently found to be homologous to Legless (Lgs), a Drosophila gene identified in a number of screens for components of the WNT signalling pathway (Kramps et al, 2002; Belenkaya et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). Lgs and BCL9 have no recognizable protein motifs and share sequence similarity only in three short stretches of 30 amino acids termed homology domains (HD) 1-3 (Kramps et al, 2002; reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012). HD1 mediates the interaction with the N-terminal ARM domain of beta-catenin while HD2 is required for the recruitment of Pygo through its C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Sampietro et al, 2006, Sierra et al, 2006). Replacement of the PHD domain of Pygo with the beta-catenin-interacting HD2 domain of Lgs rescues the phenotype of both lgs and pygo deletion in Drosophila suggesting that the primary role of Lgs is the recruitment of Pygo (Kramps et al, 2002). Transcriptional activation by Pygo depends on the conserved tripeptide NPF in the N-terminal homology domain (NHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Hoffmans and Basler, 2004; Hoffmans et al, 2005; StÃ_deli and Basler, 2005).<br>In Drosophila, Lgs is essential for Wg signalling, and deletion of either Lgs or Pygo phenocopies armadillo (the Drosophila beta-catenin homologue) null mutants (Kramps et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). In mammals, the requirement and roles for BCL9 and Pygo are both less strict and less completely understood. Unlike in Drosophila, disruption of the BCL9/Pygo branch in mammals has less impact on transcriptional activation than abrogation of beta-catenin-dependent signalling through the C-terminal tail (Valenta et al, 2011). Ablation of pygopus genes in mice does not phenocopy with loss of Wnt signaling (Song et al, 2007; Schwab et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007), and disruption of the BCL9/BCL9L beta-catenin interaction results in embryonic lethality three days later than in the case of complete disruption of beta-catenin-dependent transcription (Valenta et al, 2011). Mammalian BCL9 also has Pygo-independent roles in WNT signaling and has been shown to interact directly with other transcriptional co-activators such as CBP/p300 or TRRAP/GCN5 through its C-terminus (Sustmann et al, 2008). Finally, the PHD of Pygo is able to bind methylated histones, which may contribute to context-specific roles of the protein (Gu et al, 2009; Fielder et al, 2008; Kessler et al, 2009; Gu et al, 2012)."

Neither the mechanism by which SMO activates Hh signaling nor the manner in which PTCH represses this activty are fully elucidated, but these may involve regulation of putative SMO ligand(s) or changes in cellular localization, protein conformation and phosphorylation status, among other possibilities (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013; Ayers and Therond; 2010). <br>PTCH is a 7 transmembrane protein that is localized to the primary cilium in the absence of Hh ligand (Rohatgi et al, 2007). PTCH regulates SMO in a non-stoichiometric manner and there is little evidence that endogenous PTCH and SMO interact directly (Taipale et al, 2002; reviewed in Huangfu and Anderson, 2006). PTCH has a sterol sensing domain (SSD) and structural similarity to bacterial RND transporters. Mutation in conserved motifs in the RND domain abrogate the ability of PTCH to negatively regulate SMO activity (Taipale et al, 2002). The transmembrane heptahelical domain of SMO has been shown to bind to a number of natural and synthetic molecules, many of which are structurally related to sterols, and this binding can activate or repress SMO activity (Mas et al, 2010; Dwyer et al, 2007; Nachtergaele et al, 2012; Corcoran et al, 2006). Together, these data suggest a speculative model where PTCH regulates SMO activity by controlling the flux of sterol-related SMO agonists and/or antagonists, although this has not been fully substantiated (Khaliullina et al, 2009; reviewed in Rohatgi and Scott, 2007; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br>In the absence of Hh signal, SMO is largely found in intracellular vesicles, with a fraction localized to the plasma membrane (Milenkovic et al, 2009; Huangfu et al, 2006; Corbit et al, 2005; Rohatgi et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2009; Wilson et al, 2009). Like GLI2, 3 and SUFU, however, SMO may traffic through the cilium in the absence of ligand (Wilson et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2009). SMO and PTCH appear to have opposing localizations in both the 'off' and 'on' state, with PTCH exiting and SMO entering the cilium upon Hh pathway activation (Denef et al, 2000; Rohatgi et al, 2007; reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Hui and Angers, 2011). Clearance of PTCH from the ciliary membrane in the presence of Hh is promoted by its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SMURF (Huang et al, 2013; Yue et al, 2014)<br>Like the Drosophila homologue, vertebrate SMO appears to exists as a constitutive dimer. Dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal Cys-rich domain (CRD) and is required for function (Zhao et al, 2007). The C-terminal tail of SMO has arginine-rich clusters that appear to regulate the conformation of the tails in the dimer, maintaining the SMO dimer in an inactive state. In Drosophila, the inhibitory effect of the arginine-rich region is counteracted upon Hh pathway activation by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent serine residues. This promotes an open tail conformation that is required for cell surface accumulation and signaling (Zhao et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2010). These consensus PKA motifs are not conserved in the vertebrate SMO C-terminal tail, and a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation and direct activation of SMO appears not to hold true in mammalian cells (Zhao et al, 2007; Tuson et al, 2011).

LCN2 binds iron through association with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5DHBA), a siderophore that shares structural similarities with bacterial enterobactin, and delivers or removes iron from the cell, depending on the context. The iron-bound form of LCN2 (holo-LCN2) is internalised following binding to the solute carrier family 22 member 17 (SLC22A17) receptor, leading to release of iron which increases intracellular iron concentration and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis. This step is inferred from experiments using the highly homologous 24p3 mouse lipocalin and 24p3R mouse cell surface receptor (Devireddy et al. 2005). During infection, bacteria scavenge iron from the host cell and transfer it to the pathogen cell. Upon encountering invading bacteria, Toll-like receptors on immune cells can stimulate the transcription, translation and secretion of LCN2. LCN2 can then limit bacterial growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore so this event is pivotal in the innate immune response to bacterial infection (Flo et al. 2004)."

Xenopus and zebrafish each have one FRAT gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively (Jonkers et al, 1997; reviewed in van Amerongen and Berns, 2005). Frat proteins activate WNT signaling by binding to GSK3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004). The interaction with GSK3beta is mediated by a highly conserved IKEA box in the C-terminal domain of FRAT (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004; Thomas et al, 1999). This region of FRAT is able to compete with AXIN for binding to GSK3beta, suggesting a model where FRAT is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the GSK3beta-AXIN interaction (Farr et al, 2000; Thomas et al, 1999; Fraser at el, 2002; Ferkey et al, 2002). This model is supported by structural studies showing that AXIN and FRAT bind to the same region on the surface of GSK3beta (Bax et al, 2001; Dajani et al, 2003). Endogenous FRAT1 has also been shown to interact with DVL3, and this reaction persists in a FRAT1 mutant lacking the GSK3beta-interacting domain (Li et al, 1999). FRAT proteins may thus help bridge between GSK3betaÂ’s role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to WNT.<br><br>Despite the apparent importance of FRAT proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple FRAT knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the GBP knockout in Xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects (van Amerongen et al, 2005; Yost et al, 1989). The in vivo role and significance of the FRAT proteins in WNT signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that FRAT proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical WNT signaling in a GSK3beta-independent manner. It is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that FRAT proteins contribute to oncogenesis (van Amerongen et al, 2010; Walf-VorderwÃ_lbecke et al, 2012)."
